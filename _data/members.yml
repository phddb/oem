  bio_en: "William Duffy is a California-born, Montréal-based countertenor, praised for his 'command of the seemingly impossible high tessitura' (South Florida Classical Review). William first encountered music as a young Suzuki violinist, often facing admonishment for improvising new endings to classic repertoire. William’s appetite for variation keeps him exploring the extremes of his musical voice, finding him at various times performing jazz, Gregorian chant and music of the renaissance, baroque, and today. During the 2020-21 ongoing Covid-19 global pandemic, William was fortunate to continue making music, both in-person and virtually, with Studio de musique ancienne de Montréal, The Thirteen, Seraphic Fire, Ensemble Noir, I Musici de Montréal, and Ensemble Vocal-Arts Québec. The 2021-22 season will see William on stage in several venues across Québec for an “urban pilgrimage” concert-installation of Joby Talbot’s Path of Miracles with Voces Boreales; with Les Plaisirs du Clavecin for the world premiere of Nanumissuat - Île-Tonnerre, by Innu poet Natasha Kanapé Fontaine and Montréal composer Alexandre David; and performing J.S. Bach’s Ascension and Easter Oratorios with Ensemble Caprice."

Le goût de William pour la variation le pousse à explorer les extrêmes de sa voix musicale, le trouvant à divers moments en train d'interpréter du jazz, des chants grégoriens et de la musique de la Renaissance, de l'époque Baroque, et d'aujourd'hui. Pendant la pandémie mondiale Covid-19 de 2020-21, William a eu la chance de continuer à faire de la musique, en personne et virtuellement, avec le Studio de musique ancienne de Montréal, The Thirteen, Seraphic Fire, Ensemble Noir, I Musici de Montréal et l'Ensemble Vocal-Arts Québec. Ses prochains concerts le verront sur scène dans plusieurs grandes salles du Québec pour un concert-installation en 'pèlerinage urbain' de Path of Miracles de Joby Talbot avec Voces Boreales ; avec Les Plaisirs du Clavecin pour la première mondiale de Nanumissuat - Île-Tonnerre, de la poète innue Natasha Kanapé Fontaine et du compositeur montréalais Alexandre David ; et pour des concerts des Oratorios de Pâques et de l’Ascension de J.S.

Monsieur Giffen possède également une solide expérience de chant choral qui l'emmène à chanter avec des formations d’élites comme La Chapelle de Québec et Le Studio de Musique Ancienne de Montréal.
