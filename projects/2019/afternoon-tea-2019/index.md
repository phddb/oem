  One Equall Musick presents its second annual Afternoon Tea Fundraiser! This event includes a tea service featuring home-made desserts and other light refreshments, and a musical program highlighting the various exciting collaborations OEM has enjoyed over the years - from Medieval and Baroque music to contemporary and Sephardic repertoire. There will also be a raffle and a silent auction. Proceeds from this event will be used to offset costs for our exciting spring project, "Le rossignol d'est en ouest" in collaboration with Middle-Eastern singer Lamia Yared, on April 25.
