  English choral music was transformed in the middle years of the sixteenth century as England disavowed the church of Rome, became Protestant, then Catholic again, and finally Protestant once more. The music of Thomas Tallis embodies the evolution from the stark aesthetic of the Eton Choirbook to the refined polyphony of William Byrd. Alongside Tallisâ€™ compositions, this program includes remarkable gems hidden in rough of manuscript collections like the Wanley and Lumley Partbooks, as well as the last great English choral antiphon, William Mundy's Vox Patris Caelestis.
