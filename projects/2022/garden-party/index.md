  Come enjoy some lighthearted fun in the beautiful weather by joining One Equall Musick for a special outdoor fundraiser concert! Not only will we perform some of our favourite choral pieces, but you’ll also get to hear ensemble members showcase their individual talents with solo pieces in various styles!<br><br>
  
  There will be refreshing lemonade, iced tea, and baked goods served in the lovely backyard setting of one of our ensemble members! There will also be a selection of artisanal items up for silent auction made by ensemble members, including handmade wooden charcuterie boards and placemats.<br><br>
  
  Proceeds from this fundraiser will support some exciting new projects from One Equall Musick which combine our love of early repertoire with new adventures in contemporary music. We are looking forward to a week-long workshop this summer where we will be developing two new programs for performance in 2022-23. "Panorama: Music for Upper Voices" features an array of music by living, predominantly female composers, including a commissioned work for treble voices and cello by Canadian composer Kim Farris-Manning. "Sarah was Ninety Years Old" is structured around three pieces by Arvo Pärt and includes Renaissance and contemporary works.<br><br>
  
  Your support will enable our ensemble to grow in new directions as we return to the live concert stage. We are very excited to be developing these new programs and can't wait to share this music with you in the coming year.
