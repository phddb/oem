  The medieval Iberian peninsula, named “al-Andalus” in Arabic, was a meeting place for Jewish, Islamic, and Christian cultures. This unique environment gave birth to three great musical traditions: Sephardic, Andalusian, and Spanish Renaissance music. The vocal ensemble One Equall Musick; l’Ensemble Séfarade et Méditeranéen (ESEM); vocalist Lamia Yared, qanun player Nizar Tacharani and percussionist Nathaniel Huard weave these threads together in a program that evokes the spirit of al-Andalus.
