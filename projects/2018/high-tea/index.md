  Join us for an afternoon of Tea and scones, music and pottery auction to raise money for our upcoming season of choral concerts and collaborations. <br />

  Music will range from the first piece One Equall Musick ever performed in public, Gibbons's proto-existentialist madrigal, "What is Our Life?" to medieval French carols and chansons from past seasons, to the glorious polychoral motets of Gabrieli featured in our upcoming season. <br />

  We are so grateful for the support we've received over the years from friends and patrons. We look forward to singing for you again! <br />

  If you can't make it to the event itself but would like to support our fundraising efforts, we would be pleased to accept your support via our go fund me page: <br />
