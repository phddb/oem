    "Le rossignol d'est en ouest" is a collaboration between One Equall Musick and Lebanese singer Lamia Yared, celebrating the nightingale as a source of musical and literary inspiration in European and Middle Eastern traditions. The program includes selections from the 1597 publication <i>Le Rossignol Musical des Chansons</i> and other Renaissance works celebrating birdsong, alongside examples of <i>Muwashah</i>, an elaborate Arabic form of singing poetry; selections from the Turkish classical repertoire; and Sephardic song. The musical program will be punctuated by poetry and prose readings, while the sound of recorded birdsong and lighting effects recreate the nocturnal atmosphere of the nightingale’s famous song.
