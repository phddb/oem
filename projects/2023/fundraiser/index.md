  Come join us for an intimate evening of songs, spirits, and nibbles at the Maison Louis-Joseph Forget in Montréal's Golden Square Mile!

  Proceeds from this fundraiser will support some exciting new projects from One Equall Musick which combine our love of early reperotire with new adventures in contemporary music. We are looking forward to our March 18 program, Sarah was Ninety Years Old, which is structured around three pieces by Arvo Pärt and includes Renaissance and contemporary works. Your support will enable our ensemble to grow in new directions as we return to the live concert stage.
  
  Thanks for your support!
